# maze-generator

This project was completed for an open-ended Python assignment for CSCE 319H3: Honors Programming Paradigms at the University of Arkansas. A backtracking DFS algorithm is used to generate a maze and display it using the graphics features of the pygame package. Upon completion of one maze, a new one can be generated by clicking a button that will appear at the bottom-center of the screen.

## Required Packages:
- pygame
- pygame_widgets
- random

## Planned Features:
- Implement A* pathfinding to solve the maze
- Post-generation options:
  - Allow the user to visualize the A* pathfinding algorithm
  - Allow the user to manually solve the maze using a "player" character
  - Allow the user to save the generated maze to their device as an image
